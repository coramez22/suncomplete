	<p>This is almost certainly a scam. Scammers try to use social engineering tactics on you to gain access to your financial information or your cash app accounts. They try to do this information in several ways. They can send you fake email or text messaging alerts that direct you to a phishing site. This phishing site then steals your financial information. They can offer to wire you money. A recent scam going around was a scam text message promising $750 will be transferred. They then redirected to a scam phishing site. They sometimes impersonate Cash app staff or employees.

	If you think getting $750 is too good to be true, just know that it’s legit, BUT you have to read the instructions and you’re giving your time. As mentioned before, I spent about $10 in trying out services that I became interested in, and when I completed the deals and submitted my claim, the money arrived in a week.

I ended up getting the Disney+ streaming service as one of the Platinum deals and I love it! But if I ever get tired of Disney+, I know I can unsubscribe per Disney’s terms. The same goes for everything that Flash Rewards introduces you to.</p>
